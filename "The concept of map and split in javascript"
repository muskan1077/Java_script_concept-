"The concept of map and split in javascript"
Take one example how map is work



this is one example

const csvData = 'John,Doe,30,New York\nJane,Smith,25,San Francisco\nBob,Johnson,40,Los Angeles';

// Using split(',') to split the CSV data into an array of values
const rows = csvData.split('\n');
const dataArray = rows.map(row => row.split(','));

console.log(dataArray);

lets see in this example what is the use of map 
The map(row => row.split(',')) is commonly used to process each element of an array, in this case, an array of strings representing rows of CSV data
    .map(row => row.split(',')): This line uses the map function to iterate over each element (each row) in the rows array.
    For each row, it applies the split(',') method to split the row into an array of values, using the comma (',') as the delimiter.
    // Resulting dataArray:
[
  ['John', 'Doe', '30', 'New York'],
  ['Jane', 'Smith', '25', 'San Francisco'],
  ['Bob', 'Johnson', '40', 'Los Angeles']
]
So, the map(row => row.split(',')) expression transforms each row of CSV data into an array of values, resulting in a 2D array where each inner array represents a row with individual values. This is a common technique when dealing with CSV data or any delimited data format.


I hope you learned the map concept from above example

Lets see the use of split


The split('\n') method is commonly used to split a string into an array of substrings based on the newline character ('\n'). This is particularly useful when dealing with multiline strings, such as those that represent lines of text in a file or paragraphs in a document. Here's a general example:

const multilineText = 'This is the first line.\nThis is the second line.\nAnd this is the third line.';

// Using split('\n') to split the multiline text into an array of lines
const lines = multilineText.split('\n');

console.log(lines);

[
  'This is the first line.',
  'This is the second line.',
  'And this is the third line.'
]
This technique is commonly used when working with text data, parsing files, or processing content where line breaks are used as separators between distinct units of information.


The split(',') method is used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter, in this case, the comma (','). This method is frequently used when dealing with comma-separated values (CSV) or any data format where values are separated by commas. Here's a general example:

const csvData = 'John,Doe,30,New York\nJane,Smith,25,San Francisco\nBob,Johnson,40,Los Angeles';

// Using split(',') to split the CSV data into an array of values
const rows = csvData.split('\n');
const dataArray = rows.map(row => row.split(','));

console.log(dataArray);
[
  ['John', 'Doe', '30', 'New York'],
  ['Jane', 'Smith', '25', 'San Francisco'],
  ['Bob', 'Johnson', '40', 'Los Angeles']
]
    The csvData variable contains a string with commas separating values and newline characters ('\n') separating rows.
    The split('\n') method is first applied to split the string into an array of rows.
    Then, the split(',') method is applied to each row, resulting in a 2D array (dataArray) where each element represents a row, and each row is an array of values.

This is a common approach when working with CSV data or any data format where values are separated by a specific character, and you want to convert it into a structured array for further processing
